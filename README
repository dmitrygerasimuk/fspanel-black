F***ing Small Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is it and what can it do?

It's a panel for Unix/Linux that lists all your windows, but the difference
is that it's tiny. The binary is about 10k and it takes barely any
memory. It requires a window manager that supports the Unified Window
Manager spec: NET_WM: http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec.html

FSPanel does NOT and probably will never have any:

    * program launchers
    * menus
    * applets

Hidden Features

    * Click on the far right of the panel to make it hide.
    * Click on the far left of the panel to make it jump to top of screen.
    * Click on the numbers on the left to switch desktops.

See http://www.chatjunkies.org/fspanel/ for more information.

Changes in 0.8beta1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Switched to unified window manager spec. You now need a window
  manager that supports it. E.g. Sawfish, KWM.
* Changed the desktop pager to 1 2 3 etc buttons.
* Made it possible to compile with Xft for anti aliased text.
* Removed the clock. If you need a clock, use 0.7.
* Right-clicking a task makes it shade.

Changes in 0.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Windows that set their icons after mapping no longer get the
  generic icon.
* A new generic icon (looks better, I think).
* Fixed lockup when large amount of windows are open.
* Desktop switching arrows look different.
* Panel height and width are customizable at the top of fspanel.c.
  Made the default 24 (previously 22) and font 12. This seems to
  suite 1024x768 well, change to what suites you.
* Now uses the unified window manager spec to find the list of
  windows. Falls back to gnome spec if unavailable. This might make
  fspanel work on KDE? Note: this is only partially supported and
  uses the unified spec only for a client list, everything else
  still uses the gnome window manager spec.
* Optimized more code - i386-linux binary is now 9280 bytes!

Changes in 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The clock now updates on-the-minute.
* Optimized some code - binary is 300 bytes smaller :)
* Made it possible to compile without libXpm.
* Included some Makefiles for FreeBSD and Solaris.
* No crash when display fails to open.

Changes in 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fix refresh for XFree86 4.
* Fix switching desktops (works in Sawfish now too).
* Make windows focus when raising.
